This is where you would put your DTO classes to be used 
with RestSharp or any REST client. 

DTO classes usually are POCO classes, which has no methods.

You cand define all DTO classes inside the DTO.cs file.

A simple example is shown here:

class MyDTO
{
	public string StringValue;
	public int NumericValue;
}
